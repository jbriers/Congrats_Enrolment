# Congratulations on your Enrolment

One of the projects during the Android Basics Nanodegree.  A card developed for fellow students.

This was pretty exciting to develope, part of the assigment task is to display your sketch, the screen shot, and a 2 minute video describing your path.  You can see that on my YouTube channel
